* We fixed an issue that caused the dashboard not to show all recently run test suites and test cases.
* We fixed an issue that caused the **Confirm subscription** link to show a message stating something went wrong when confirming the subscription, even when the subscription was successfully confirmed.

## 2.28.8

**Release date: March 7th, 2023**

### Fixes

* When (un)subscribing to schedules, the browser showed HTML instead of rendering it as a page. This has been fixed.

* We fixed an issue where old test-case and test-suite executions were not deleted after 90 days, despite the log retention time being set to 90 days.
* On sign-up, links to the privacy statement and terms and conditions no longer return a 404 error.
