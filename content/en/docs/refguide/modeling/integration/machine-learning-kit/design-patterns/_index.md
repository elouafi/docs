{{% alert color="info" %}}[Machine learning model](/refguide/machine-learning-kit/) support is currently in [Beta](/releasenotes/beta-features/), and is available in Studio Pro [9.23](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.23/) and above.{{% /alert %}}

## 1 Introduction

Design patterns are implementation patterns for machine learning models. The documents in this section include ideas, guidance, and specifications when using specific patterns with *ML Kit* in Studio Pro [9.23](/releasenotes/studio-pro/9.23/) and above.

For detailed information on working with machine learning models in Studio Pro, see [Integrate Machine Learning Models](/refguide/machine-learning-kit/).
